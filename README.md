# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Final Project – Vulnerability Assessment Report

> ✅ **Certified by Internshala**
> 📅 **Date of Certification**: July 21, 2023
> 🖥️ **Target**: E-commerce Web Application (Simulated Real-World Environment)

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the final submission for the **Ethical Hacking Training Project** by Internshala. The objective was to perform a **realistic penetration test** on a mock e-commerce platform, identify vulnerabilities, and create a **developer-level vulnerability report** with step-by-step Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and actionable remediations.

---

## 🧪 Scope of Work

As part of the project:

* Performed a black-box vulnerability assessment of a web application.
* Identified and documented **28+ vulnerabilities**, including both common and critical flaws.
* Followed industry-standard reporting format including business impact and remediation.
* Explored hidden components, bypasses, and insecure configurations.
* Verified vulnerabilities with PoCs, payloads, and screenshots.

## 🎯 Target Vulnerabilities (Intentionally Planted)

The following vulnerabilities were expected to be discovered and reported:

* 🔓 SQL Injection (SQLi)
* 🖊️ Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* 🧾 Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* 🚀 Rate Limiting Issues
* 📤 Insecure File Uploads
* 🔄 Client-Side Filter Bypasses
* ⚙️ Server Misconfigurations
* 🧩 Components with Known Vulnerabilities
* 🔑 Weak Passwords
